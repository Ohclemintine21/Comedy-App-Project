Project Overview

I worked with a team of developers to create a beautiful comedy application that allows users to search through a comedy archive to find out information about their favorite comedies. Our job was to create functionality by using Python, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SQL and Django.

My job was to create a database, create a form that adds a new comedy to the database, check it for errors/duplicates and create a function that renders the home page by utilizing Python. Below is some the code used to create the database and render the homepage.

Conclusion

This Project was one of my first experiences working with a team of developers and completing an application by utlizing Agile/Scrum methodlogies. We stayed on track with sprint meetings and organized story boards to ensure successful completion of the application. It was an amazing opportunity to see how these coding languages come together to create something functional and visually pleasing from the ground up. Thrilled to take the skills I gained from this project into future projects.
